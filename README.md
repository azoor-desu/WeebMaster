A simple app that helps you memorize japanese alphabets somewhat better, with tracking of stats like:
Times attempted the alphabet, times got the alphabet correct, total Accuracy of this alphabet

Also comes with a handy hiragana/katakana chart!
Also allows you to nuke your shitty stats you don't like!

Batteries not included.

Project done using Unity 2018.3.14f1. 

Download it, edit it, use it, sell it, I don't care. Credits are nice but it's okay if you don't too. Not that wou would be using much of this shitty app anyway.
