A simple app that helps you memorize japanese alphabets somewhat better. Features include: Selecting groups of characters to bash, endless mode, timings and scores! (Scores not even tracked lmaoo)

Also comes with a handy hiragana/katakana chart!
Also allows you to nuke your shitty stats you don't like!

Batteries not included.

Project done using Unity 2019.1.6f1. 

Download it, edit it, use it, sell it, I don't care. Credits are nice but it's okay if you don't too. Not that wou would be using much of this shitty app anyway.
